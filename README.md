# AppleIntelligenceExamples

A repo with examples from my early 2025 talk about currently available parts of Apple Intelligenceâ„¢. 

Links to slides and/or videos will be added as they go up. 

Includes: 

- Image Playgrounds
- Genmoji
- Writing Tools (both TextKit 1 and TextKit 2)
- Translation

**NOTE:** Basically all of this must be run on device. You must update the Apple Development team account in the xcodeproj -> Build Settings to your own for that to work.
